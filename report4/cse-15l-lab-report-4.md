## Reviewed markdown-parse repository: [Link](https://github.com/jina-leemon/markdown-parser)

## Snippet 1
* Expected output: [url.com, google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]
* Image of the code for the test: ![Snippet 1](snippet1Test.jpg)
* Output of **my implementation**
* Output of **reviewed implementation**

* I think there is/isn't a small code change that will make the program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks.

## Snippet 2
* Expected output: [a.com, b.com, a.com(()), example.com]
* Image of the code for the test: ![Snippet 2](snippet2Test.jpg)
* Output of **my implementation**
* Output of **reviewed implementation**

* I think there is/isn't a small code change that will make the program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets.

## Snippet 3
* Expected output: [https://www.twitter.com, https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule, github.com, https://cse.ucsd.edu/]
* Image of the code for the test: ![Snippet 3](snippet3Test.jpg)
* Output of **my implementation**
* Output of **reviewed implementation**

* I think there is/isn't a small code change that will make the program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses.
